Printf has overadozen such conversions, which Go programmers cal l verb s. This table is far
from a complete specification but illustrates many of the features that are available:
```
%d decimal integer
%x, %o, %b integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary
%f, %g, %e floating-point number: 3.141593 3.141592653589793 3.141593e+00
%t boolean: true or false
%c rune (Unicode code point)
%s string
%q quot ed str ing "abc" or rune 'c'
%v any value in a natural format
%T type of any value
%% literal percent sign (no operand)
%#v includes struct field names using Go syntax
%*s prints the string padded with variable number of spaces
```
A map is a reference to the data structure created by make. When a map is passed to a function,
the function receives a copy of the reference, so any changes the called function makes to
the underlying data structure will be visible through the callerâ€™s map reference too. In our
example, the values inserted into the counts map by countLines are seen by main.

A goroutine is a concurrent function execution. A channel is a communication mechanism
that allows one goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutine. The function
main runs in a goroutine and the go statement creates additional goroutines.
##### 1.7 A web server
The server has two handlers, and the request URL determines which one is called: a request
for /count invokes counter and all others invoke handler. A handler pattern that ends with
a slash matches any URL that has the pattern as aprefix. Behind the scenes, the server runs
the handler for each incoming request in a separate goroutine so that it can serve multiple
requests simultaneously.
##### 1.8 Loose Ends
Cases do not fall through from one to thenext as in C-like languages (though there is a rarely 
used **fallthrough** statement that overrides this behavior).
